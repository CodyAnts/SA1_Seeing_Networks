                <p>Chorus is a New Zealand company that split off from Telecom NZ (Now Spark) in 2011. They are responsible for building approximately 70% of the new fibre optic Ultra Fast Broadband Network. Some of the poles on the streets, such as these, are soley owned by Chorus, and are used for connecting the network to a premise, or to support the network along the street.</p>

                <p>The majority of the cables in this network are run underground, but in places where this is not possible, Chorus erected poles to support their cables. Around 280,000 such poles exist nationwide.</p>

            	<p>Chorus has an agreement with the power companies that actually own these power poles, which enables them to share the poles and use them to support their network without having to either erect their own poles or dig the cables underground, in places where that may not be viable.</p>

                <p>This system, while advantageous for Chorus as it makes their job a lot easier, is definitely not the most tidy solution. Here we can see a power pole that splits off live power lines to several other poles, admist a clutter of fibre and copper network cables.</p>

                <p>Cabinets such as these provide interconnection points for about half of the lines in the Chorus network. Around 11,000 of these are scattered around the country. A large number of these are like "mini telephone exchanges" with electronic broadband equipment installed.</p>

                <p>In 2010 Chorus began a trial to discover whether artwork painted onto their cabinets would discourage tagging. The trial proved sucessful, and Chorus now allows local artists to paint their cabinets, such as the one seen here, celebrating Wellington's Queer and Trans Whanau.</p>

                <p>Plinths such as these are very common and serve as a connection point between a cabinet to a proprty boundary. The copper or fibre cables are then run from this point into the premise.</p>
